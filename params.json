Nothing more.\r\n\r\nRather than starting with everything but the kitchen sink, start with the bare minimum and add dependencies on an as needed basis.\r\n\r\nSee this blog post for a detailed description and comparisons of various ways of packaging: [Microcontainers - Tiny, Portable Containers](http://www.iron.io/blog/2016/01/microcontainers-tiny-portable-containers.html).\r\n\r\n## Getting Started with Microcontainers\r\nIf you're ready to start building your own Microcontainers for your applications, you can use the prebuilt iron/LANG images as a base. They all be found here: https://github.com/iron-io/dockers. And you can see examples of using the iron/LANG images here: https://github.com/iron-io/dockerworker\r\n\r\n## Support or Contact\r\n[Create an issue](https://github.com/iron-io/microcontainers/issues).
